# Chapter 3 - Stacks and queues
# Very unlikely to be asked to implement a stack / queue during an interview.
# Questions will focus on usage
#
# Additional questions
#   - Linked lists 2.7
#   - Math and probability 7.7

# 3.1 Describe how you could use a single array to implement 3 stacks

# 3.2 How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop,
# also has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and
# min should all operate in O(1) time

# 3.3 Imagine a stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
#  Therefore we would start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some
# threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this.
# SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new
# stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. push and pop should behave
# identically to a single stack.
#
# Follow up: Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop
# operation on a specific sub-stack

# 3.4 Implement the towers of Hanoi problem (with a stack)

# 3.5 Implement a queue class using two stacks

# 3.6 Write a problem to sort a stack in ascending order. At most one
# additional stack may be used to hold items but these items must not be
# copied into any other data structure. The stack supports the following
# operations: push, pop, peek and isEmpty

# 3.7 An animal shelter only holds dogs and cats and operates on a strictly
# FIFO basis. People must adopt the oldest of all animals at the shelter or
# select whether they prefer or dog / cat and receive the oldest animal of
# that type. They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create
#  data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as
# enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog and dequeueCat. May use the built-in linked
#  list data structure.
